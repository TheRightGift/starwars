# A reactJs implementation of starwars movies list.

## Features

### All characters that appear in that movie should be listed showing name, gender, and height in the form of a table.
### Gender can be shown as an icon or abbreviation to save horizontal space.
### Character list can be sorted by clicking on the table headers.
### Clicking on the same header twice toggles the sort order by the field between ascending and descending.
### There should also be a gender filter selection right above the list so that either all characters are listed or only the selected gender are listed.
### The last row of the table should show the total number of characters currently visible on the list.
### The last row should also show the sum of the heights of the characters currently visible.
### The sum of heights should be shown both in cm and in feet/inches in parenthesis, for example, 170 cm (5ft/6.93in)
